# My Excuse App

## Quick note:

Sarmi, if you ever see this, yeah, I took the idea behind the repo you shared with us in "desarrollo" a while back and decided to create my own version. I had no clue about what the app would do and decided to just steal the repo's idea.

## Description:

I was told I needed to learn the fundamentals of some stuff so I decided to do it on a practical way and created this project.

## Latest commit:

Now working over the testing branch until it gets tested.

## 21/02/2025: Now under the testing branch:

- Updated the app.py so it works with the DB connection.
- Abstracted the DB connection to a new file called db.py
- Created the item_model.py file to define the ItemModel class.
- Created the item_routes.py file to define the item routes.
