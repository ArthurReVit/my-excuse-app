# My Excuse App

## Quick note:

Sarmi, if you ever see this, yeah, I took the idea behind the repo you shared with us in "desarrollo" a while back and decided to create my own version. I had no clue about what the app would do and decided to just steal the repo's idea.

## Description:

I was told I needed to learn the fundamentals of some stuff so I decided to do it on a practical way and created this project.

## 21/02/2025: Ready to merge with the master branch:

- Updated the item_routes.py file to include the update and delete routes.
- Tested and proved that the app works as expected.
